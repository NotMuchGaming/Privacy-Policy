Slide and Glide - Privacy Policy
Effective Date: 3 March 2024

Introduction

This Privacy Policy is for Slide and Glide (the "Game"), a game developed by NotMuchGaming ("we", "us", or "our"). This Privacy Policy informs you about our data practices related to the Game.

Information We Collect

In-app purchases are the only data we collect through the Game. When you make an in-app purchase, the platform holder (e.g., Google Play, App Store) collects your payment information and account details. We only receive a confirmation of the purchase and not your sensitive financial data.

How We Use Your Information

We use information about your in-app purchases to fulfill your purchase requests and manage the in-app store functionality within the Game. This allows us to provide you with the purchased digital content or service.

Information Sharing

We do not share any information about your in-app purchases with third parties except for the platform holder who facilitates the transaction. They will have their own privacy policy that governs their collection and use of your data.

Your Choices

In-app purchases are handled through the platform holder's system. You can manage your purchase history and settings through your platform account.

Data Retention

We retain information about your in-app purchases for as long as necessary to manage your purchases, fulfill your requests, and comply with applicable laws.

Security

We take reasonable measures to secure your in-app purchase information. However, no data transmission over the internet can be guaranteed to be completely secure.

Children's Privacy

We do not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 13. If you are a parent or guardian and you believe that your child has made an in-app purchase without your consent, please contact the platform holder following their instructions.

Changes to this Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on the Game.
